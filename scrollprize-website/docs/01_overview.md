In 2023, the Vesuvius Challenge made history by reading the inside of a Herculaneum scroll without opening it.
A combination of competition and community collaboration helped us get there.
In 2024, our goal is to go from reading 5% of a scroll to 90%.
There is much to be done - please join us!

## Current state

In 2023 we awarded more than [$1,000,000](winners) across 53 prizes, resulting in the historic breakthrough of reading the inside of a Herculaneum scroll.
As a part of Stage 2, we have now announced a 2024 Grand Prize, as well as another series of progress prizes, to help us get from 5% to 90% of the scroll.
