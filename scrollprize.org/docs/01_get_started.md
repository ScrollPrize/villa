**You** can make history, win prizes, and help read the lost library of the Herculaneum scrolls. Here's how:

### 1. Join the community

Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/uTfNwwecCQ), subscribe to our [mailing list](https://scrollprize.substack.com), follow [@scrollprize](https://x.com/scrollprize) on X, and complete our [community survey](https://forms.gle/mtA3B4uQusVFTEDu9).

### 2. See a scroll

Get a feel for [the data](data) by looking inside a scroll that has not been opened in 2,000 years:
* [In your browser](https://dl.ash2txt.org/view/Scroll1)
* [In 1-2 lines of Python](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/tree/main/vesuvius) (or [in C](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/tree/main/vesuvius-c)!)

### 3. Dive in

Our goal is to read the entire library, starting with a complete scroll:

<Admonition type="tip" icon="📜" title="Grand Prize">
* Prizes: \$200,000 [Read Entire Scroll Prize](prizes#read-entire-scroll-prize-200000)
* Starting point: [The Data](data), [The Tutorials](tutorial)
</Admonition>

There are currently two primary subproblems where we need your help:

<Admonition type="info" icon="⚙️" title="Segmentation">
* Prizes: [Progress Prizes](prizes#progress-prizes)
* Starting point: [Virtual Unwrapping](unwrapping), [Segmentation tutorial](segmentation), [Segmentation - a different approach](tutorial4)
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" icon="🖋️" title="Ink Detection">
* Prizes: 4 x \$60,000 [First Letters and First Title Prizes](prizes#first-letters-and-title-prizes)
* Starting point: [Ink detection tutorial](tutorial5)
</Admonition>

### 4. Utilize resources

Find more information about our datasets ([data page](data)) and what to do with them ([tutorials](tutorial)).

There are many great tools and resources that you can use and contribute to:

<Admonition type="danger" icon="🌎" title="Open Source">
* Prizes: [Progress Prizes](prizes#progress-prizes)
* Starting point: [Awesome Scroll Tools](community_projects) and [Progress Prizes Wish List](prizes#wish-list)
</Admonition>

For prototyping new ideas, we particularly recommend the [Python](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/tree/main/vesuvius) and [C](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/villa/tree/main/vesuvius-c) libraries for easily working with scroll data.
