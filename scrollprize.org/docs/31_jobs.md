## Geometry and Computer Vision Applied Researcher

The Vesuvius Challenge applied researchers advance the frontier of the most promising research directions from our community, furthering progress on the most promising research avenues in virtual unwrapping and related problems.

#### Overview
If the Vesuvius Challenge community performs a breadth-first search of research ideas to help us read the scrolls, this role performs depth-first search. We (and you!) are laser focused on solving the remaining hurdles to extract these hidden texts from their scroll confines.

We process volumetric CT data of scrolls, and are working to solve a challenging segmentation problem (mapping the surface of the crumpled scroll within the volume) as well as ink detection (using machine learning to detect the subtle presence of ink within the scan). This role will pursue the most promising methods on the data, adapt to follow emerging directions, and share the results along the way with our technical community.

We are looking for individuals who can review the [Virtual Unwrapping](unwrapping) problem overview and contribute concrete and actionable research ideas.

#### Example tasks might include:
- Implement optimization algorithms to fit 3D surfaces to complex data
- Process high-dimensional images using classical and machine learning methods
- Optimize data formats for storage space, accuracy and accessibility
- Implement and train neural networks for segmentation of 3D image data
- Process non-watertight manifold triangular meshes and other geometrical objects
- Optimize existing tools to run faster or with fewer resources on large image datasets
- Polish and publish community-developed proofs of concept
- Perform deformable registration of 3D objects
- Analyze and validate pipeline steps with complex metrics, and define those metrics

#### Qualifications:
- Image/geometry processing experience, ideally with large or high dimensional datasets
- Experience implementing and training neural networks
- Generalist/excited to pursue flexible directions
- Previous research experience in a related domain (PhD-level, but PhD not required)

#### To Apply
Send your resume, cover letter, and examples of relevant projects to jobs@scrollprize.org. Include "Applied Researcher" in the subject line.
