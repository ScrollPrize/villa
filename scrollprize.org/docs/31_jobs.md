# Jobs

We are laser focused on our mission of reading the Herculaneum scrolls and are always interested in talking.
If you think you would be a good fit, please reach out to team@scrollprize.org.


## Annotation Specialist 

Help us unravel the mysteries of the only remaining library from antiquity! 

### Role
As an Annotation Specialist you will analyze and process volumetric CT scan data from ancient scrolls, which were carbonized and buried at Herculaneum two thousand years ago during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. 

### Overview
The most important requirement is the capacity to sustain a high level of engagement in complex repetitive tasks. Computer literacy and experience looking at data are strongly suggested, and direct experience in medical annotation or similar is a bonus. Scroll annotation has many flavors in 2D and 3D, and will be an evolving landscape. 

A good fit comes down to personality as much as skill sets. Maybe you have strong gaming skills, or rebuild vintage watches as a hobby. If fast-paced repetitive complex tasks sound relaxing, this may be for you! 

This is not a programming position, and the majority of your time will be spent in the trenches annotating papyrus. However, this is geometry research, so experience writing code, beta-testing and debugging software, algorithm development, graphics, general data science, visual art and other creative skills will all be of great benefit. 

This is a full-time position (30+ hours/week). 

### Key Responsibilities
- Master several techniques for annotating X-ray CT scans of scrolls with evolving software
- Collaborate with researchers to develop and test new annotation tooling 
- Document processes and maintain consistent standards
- Ensure access to a fast internet connection

### Required Skills 
- Capacity to sustain a high level of engagement in complex repetitive tasks
- Attention to detail
- Excellent communication skills
- Familiarity with basic Linux command line operations 

### Preferred Qualifications
- Experience with volumetric image segmentation and annotation
- Experience beta-testing and debugging software
- Graphics and algorithm development
- C/C++, Python

### Impact
Not only will you unroll ancient scrolls and be the first human to lay eyes on the resulting text in two millennia, your efforts will directly contribute to automation of unrolling, which is a key ingredient to help catalyze further excavation of Herculaneum and unearth the only remaining library from antiquity before it is too late! 

### To Apply
Send your resume, cover letter, and examples of relevant projects to ben@scrollprize.org. Include "Annotation Specialist" in the subject line.
