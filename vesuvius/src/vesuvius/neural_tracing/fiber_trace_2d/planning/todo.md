# v0.1 initial fiber tracing

- switch the model to a 10 deep resnet 64 channels
- profiling and speed!
    - lets add bechmark mode - --benchmark should run the training skipping testing and only over the first 100 batches then report samples/s (thats "images" in the cnn - e.g. individual patches)
    - then add --profile which should measure timings by stage: coord gen, coord aug, loading (zarr read/sampling), image augs, fw, bw+step
    - should output summary after running the 100 batches on the time each stage takes avg pe sample
    - also output per sample the values (print table-like so its easy to read)
